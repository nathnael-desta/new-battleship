/**
 * The default implementation of an instance restorer.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * The lifecycle for state restoration is subtle. The sequence of events is:
 *
 * 1. The instance restorer plugin is instantiated. It installs itself as the
 *    layout database that the application shell can use to `fetch` and `save`
 *    layout restoration data.
 *
 * 2. Other plugins that care about state restoration require the instance
 *    restorer as a dependency.
 *
 * 3. As each load-time plugin initializes (which happens before the lab
 *    application has `started`), it instructs the instance restorer whether
 *    the restorer ought to `restore` its state by passing in its tracker.
 *    Alternatively, a plugin that does not require its own instance tracker
 *    (because perhaps it only creates a single widget, like a command palette),
 *    can simply `add` its widget along with a persistent unique name to the
 *    instance restorer so that its layout state can be restored when the lab
 *    application restores.
 *
 * 4. After all the load-time plugins have finished initializing, the lab
 *    application `started` promise will resolve. This is the `first`
 *    promise that the instance restorer waits for. By this point, all of the
 *    plugins that care about restoration will have instructed the instance
 *    restorer to `restore` their state.
 *
 * 5. The instance restorer will then instruct each plugin's instance tracker
 *    to restore its state and reinstantiate whichever widgets it wants. The
 *    tracker returns a promise to the instance restorer that resolves when it
 *    has completed restoring the tracked widgets it cares about.
 *
 * 6. As each instance finishes restoring, it resolves the promise that was
 *    made to the instance restorer (in step 5). After all of the promises that
 *    the restorer is awaiting have resolved, the restorer then resolves its
 *    `restored` promise allowing the application shell to rehydrate its saved
 *    layout.
 *
 * Of particular note are steps 5 and 6: since state restoration of plugins
 * is accomplished by executing commands, the command that is used to restore
 * the state of each plugin must return a promise that only resolves when the
 * widget has been created and added to the plugin's instance tracker.
