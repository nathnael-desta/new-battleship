/**
 * An abstract base class for creating Phosphor layouts.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * A layout is used to add widgets to a parent and to arrange those
 * widgets within the parent's DOM node.
 *
 * This class implements the base functionality which is required of
 * nearly all layouts. It must be subclassed in order to be useful.
 *
 * Notably, this class does not define a uniform interface for adding
 * widgets to the layout. A subclass should define that API in a way
 * which is meaningful for its intended use.
